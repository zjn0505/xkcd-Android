Kudos to Randall, glory to all xkcd lovers.

This is yet another xkcd comics and what if articles viewer, while I'm refining it to become the best one, an easy and lite app with best in-app browsing experience.

 This app has so far:
 - the best support to all those large xkcd comics. e.g. No. 657, 1040, and the toughest No. 980.
 - native support for interactive comics like 1608, 2198, etc
 - the best experience to read what if articles on mobile screen.
 - the most fantastic list to browse xkcd archive.
 - the quickest and most convenient way to check Explainxkcd, just hold and tap.
 - the adorable favorite and thumb-up feature to your beloved comics and articles.
 
I am actively improving this app and related services, and it is fully open-sourced for every aspect of code on Github.
